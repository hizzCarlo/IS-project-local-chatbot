Factorial is a fundamental concept in mathematics, denoted by an exclamation mark following a number. The factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \), written as \( n! \), is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \( n \). Here are some key points about factorials:

1. **Definition**:
   - For any positive integer \( n \), \( n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \).
   - By definition, \( 0! = 1 \).

2. **Examples**:
   - \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \)
   - \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)

3. **Recursive Definition**:
   - \( n! = n \times (n-1)! \) for \( n > 0 \).
   - This recursive approach is useful for computing factorials, especially for larger numbers.

4. **Growth Rate**:
   - Factorials grow very rapidly as the number increases. For example, \( 10! = 3,628,800 \), and this continues to grow much faster than exponential functions.

5. **Applications**:
   - Used in permutations and combinations for probability theory.
   - Found in binomial coefficients, such as in the formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \).

6. **Notational Considerations**:
   - The exclamation mark is commonly used to denote factorial but should not be confused with other uses of this symbol.

In summary, factorials are essential for understanding permutations and combinations and grow rapidly with the input number. They have numerous applications in mathematics and beyond.
